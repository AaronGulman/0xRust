# Rusty-Web

So here’s the deal: I clocked over 100 hours deep-diving into Go—yeah, went way past that initial 100-hour goal. After wrapping that up, I thought, “Why not take Rust for a spin?” 😎

I have coded in C and C++ before - I’ve always had a thing for low-level: high-performance system programming—embedded or otherwise so Rust felt like the natural next step. 

Now I’m neck-deep in it, building Rusty-web, a fast, async HTTP server powered by Tokio and sqlx.

Who knows? Maybe I’ll earn my Rustacean badge soon. 🦀
